THOUGHTS

5 areas with chests
Flags for difficulty
Have to siege them to take rewards
Day/night - attacked at night, enemies spawn out of LOS and top up the flagged areas

Get all chests to win
They turn to osiris piece box and move back to spaceship
Of course they attract a lot of heat

Missile choice
Area off map
3 slots
1 for default
2 for relics to be picked up
And assigned via choice dialog (except first two as will default)
Timeout to drop relic

OR relic system
